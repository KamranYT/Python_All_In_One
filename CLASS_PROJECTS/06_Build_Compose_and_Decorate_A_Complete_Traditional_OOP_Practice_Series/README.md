# OOP Practice Assessment: Python Class, Composition, and Decorator Exercises

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive set of Python exercises designed to help you master traditional Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The assessment covers a wide range of OOP topics, from basic class construction to advanced features like decorators, custom exceptions, and iterables.

All exercises are contained in a single file: `main.py`. Each exercise is clearly separated and commented, making it easy to work through them sequentially or focus on specific topics.

## Topics Covered

1. **Using `self`**: Class attributes and instance methods
2. **Using `cls`**: Class variables and class methods
3. **Public Variables and Methods**
4. **Class Variables and Class Methods**
5. **Static Variables and Static Methods**
6. **Constructors and Destructors**
7. **Access Modifiers**: Public, Protected, and Private
8. **The `super()` Function**: Inheritance and base class initialization
9. **Abstract Classes and Methods**
10. **Instance Methods**
11. **Class Methods**
12. **Static Methods**
13. **Composition**: Using objects within other objects
14. **Aggregation**: Object references and relationships
15. **Method Resolution Order (MRO) and Diamond Inheritance**
16. **Function Decorators**
17. **Class Decorators**
18. **Property Decorators**: `@property`, `@setter`, and `@deleter`
19. **`callable()` and `__call__()`**: Making objects callable
20. **Creating a Custom Exception**
21. **Making a Custom Class Iterable**

## How to Use

1. **Open `main.py`** in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.
2. Each exercise is provided as a commented code block. To practice an exercise:
   - Uncomment the relevant section.
   - Run the file to see the output and experiment with the code.
3. You can work through the exercises in order or jump to any topic of interest.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external libraries are required; all exercises use standard Python features.

## Learning Goals

- Understand and apply OOP principles in Python
- Practice class design, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism
- Gain hands-on experience with decorators, custom exceptions, and iterables
- Learn best practices for structuring and organizing Python code
